# ARES - Advanced Reasoning Engine for Streams 

**ARES** started as a C++ implementation of the [Laser](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/expressive-stream-reasoning-with-ares) a stream reasoning engine 
based on the [LARS logic framework](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/dhsr/pub/2015/bdef2015-aaai.pdf)   
It has since been extended to increase expresivity and allow existentialy quantified variables.  

### Prerequisites
ARES requires:
* C++ compiler compliant with C++17 standard (tested on GCC 7.3.0 and 
Clang 6.0.0)
* CMake (minimum version: 3.7, tested on 3.10)
* GTest suite (tested on version 1.8.0) (optional)
* gdb (optional)

## Getting Started

Interact with ARES by using the `ares.sh` script. 

Build and test ARES by executing:
```
./ares.sh r 
```

Run all test cases by executing:
```
./ares.sh t 
```

See all options by running:
```
./ares.sh h 
```

**Program**

Programs are composed of one or more rules, separated by new-line character '\n'.

Each rule is written as: `head := body`. Both *head* and *body* are formulas. 

The simplest type of formula is an Atom, which is composed of a predicate and
some variables, e.g.: `a(X, Y, X)`. In this atom, *a* is the predicate, while 
*X*, *Y*, and *Z* are variables.

More complex formulas can be represented by adding a unary operator in front 
of another
formula, or a binary operator between two formulas. 
These operators are written as: 
```
Diamond: [D]
Box: [B]
Time Window: [$, size]
Tuple Window: [#, size]
Time reference: [@, time_variable]
Conjunction: &&
```
Please note that the head of a ARES rule is limited to conjunctions of atomic 
and time reference formulas.
Example program:
```
u(X) := [#, 1][D]f(X)
f(Y) := [$, 5] [B] e(Y, Y)
a(T, Z) := [@, T] b(Z)
[@, T]c(S) := [@, T] d(S)
i(V, W) := g(W) && h(V)
```

**Input Stream**

The file containing the input stream needs to start with a line containing two 
numbers: the first and last time-point in the stream.
Each line after has the following format: `time-point : facts`. Facts are grounded
atoms separated by commas. Time-points should be in order.
Example input stream:
```
1 14 
1 : q(1), p(1), e(a4, b6)
2 : p(2), a(3, 1, 8)
3 : 
4 : p(41), q(1) 
4 : p(8)
5 : a(4, 8, 12)
12 : a(56, 99, 0), p(1)
```

### Project organization
The code of ARES can be found in directories **include** (header files) and 
**src** (C++ source files). 
The project is divided in 4 modules (*core*, *rule*, *forumula*, 
*util*). Each module can be found in a dedicated sub-directory of *include*
and *src* respectively. The sub-directory *example* contains implementations of 
*rule::RuleReader* and *core::IOManager* interfaces. 

The directory **test** contains contains some test cases which can be found in 
*test/testcase/*. The directory also contains and application that runs some 
hardcoded programs on hard-coded input. The source-code of this application can 
be found in *test/main.cpp*.

### ARES modules: (!outdated)

**Core** - handles input-output as well as execution of the ARES program. 

**Rule** - parses ARES programs and evaluates the rules on the input facts
provided by the stream. 

**Formula** - Evaluates the different formulas found in the program and stores
the result. 

**Util** - Contains classes useful in other modules such as exceptions, timeline.
Instances of the Grounding class present in this module are used as the basic 
block of data throughout the ARES reasoning engine. It is used to represent
such data as input facts, output conclusions or store annotated groudings of 
formulas present in the program being evaluated. 

### Implementing reasoner applications using the  ARES engine

ARES is a reasoning engine that can be used to implement systems capable of
real-time semantic inference on stream of data. 

In order to implement a reasoning application, the user need only to implement 
the 
`ares::core::IOManager` interface found in 
*include/core/io_manager.h*. This 
implementation should reflect the application specific needs regarding reading
and parsing of the input stream, as well as formatting and writing of the output
stream. An example of such an implementation can be found in the folder 
*include/example* and *src/example*.  

ARES comes with a built in *RuleParser* class found in the _rule_ module. 
If the application requires a diferent syntax for expressing logic rules, 
users can implement their own rule parser instead.

Once the *IOManager* interface is implemented, 
an application can use the ARES 
reasoning engine by constructing an instance of the `ares::core::Reasoner` class
found in *include/core/reasoner.h* and *src/core/reasoner.cpp* respectively.

ARES stores global settings in the `ares::util::Settings` class.
The class includes settings such as the chase algorithm used to materialize 
existentially quantified values. 
This settings should be set before parsing the rules and intantiating the 
_Reasoner_ class. 

### TODO: example!!!


### Debuging

ARES comes with a testing application. 
The source code for this application can be found in the directory 
*test/* and can be executed by running:
```
./ares.sh r 
```

The test application runs a series of hardcoded ARES programs on hardcoded input.
This is useful for debuging, as a specific ARES program can be run in GDB. 
Simply edit the code in *test/main.cpp*, build and execute:
```
./ares.sh d 
```
